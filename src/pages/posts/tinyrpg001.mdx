I'm working on a basic Todo MVC style app called Goal Tracker - you can find it here [Goal Tracker](https://replit.com/@triptych/Goal-Tracker?v=1)

I've been inspired after creating this to discover this article about creating content and apps via Vanilla JS [here](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/vanilla-javascript-todomvc/) and I plan to keep updating my goal tracker with techniques learned from this app.

In general, I'm investing heavily into Replit. You'll see a lot of new things here from me - and all my work will be here and saved on GitHub.
