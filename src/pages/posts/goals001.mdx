I did a minor update to my Tiny RPG code - you can find it [here](https://replit.com/@triptych/TinyRPG?v=1). 

I plan to continue to update, fix, improve, and generally make it super awesome as a way to keep up my JS and general web dev skills, as well as try out more game development stuff.

I'm also working on this blog - constantly improving and updating.
I'm learning that it's better to get something out - slightly working - then keep updating it than waiting forever to release a perfect project.
